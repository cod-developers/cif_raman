# cif_raman
This repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of
an ontology describing Raman spectroscopy experiments. The ontology is
expressed as a [CIF2](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576715021871)
dictionary file that conforms to the dictionary definition language
([DDLm](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci300075z)).

## Maintainers
The ontology is maintained by an international team of volunteer
Raman specialists associated with the Raman Open Database.

## Versioning
The dictionary files are versioned as described in [Semantic
Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

All previously released dictionary versions can be found in the
*/dictionaries* directory.

Since the ontology is undergoing rapid development the **1.0.0** is
still to be released.

## DDLm conformity

All dictionary files conform to the DDLm flavour that is maintained
by the International Union of Crystallography
(IUCr, [https://www.iucr.org/](https://www.iucr.org/)). It should be
noted that it differs from the one described in the
[original publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci300075z). Please
consult the official IUCr website for more information.

## Compatability
Even though the ontology itself is expressed as a CIF2 file it is
designed to be compatible with both CIF1 and CIF2 syntax.

## Adoption
Currently, the ontology is mainly used in the Raman Open Database
(ROD, [http://solsa.crystallography.net](http://solsa.crystallography.net)).

## Acknowledgements
The initial development of the ontology has received funding from
the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under
grant agreement No. 689868.
